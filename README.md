# Train-Scheduler

<h2>Train Scheduler</h2>
<p>This is a program that allows you to make a train and the schedule that it will follow</p>

<ul>
<li>This program is made using HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, JQuery, and Firebase.</li>
<li>You fill out the input fields with the appropiate information and then the program calculates the info and with the help of Firebase stores it on their server and then appends the info onto HTML.</li>
<li>As the time passes, the train schedule will continue to update and change. When the train arrives, it will restart on the same schedule that it was on previously just with an updated arrival time.</li>
</ul>
